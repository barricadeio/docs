By default, Agents are optimized to handle heavy traffic without impacting on the performance of your server - but you can always change the configuration to suit your needs.

### Configuration File

Config settings can be found and modified in this file on your server: 

`/etc/barricade/barricade.cfg`

Once updated, a restart is **required** for any changes to take effect:

`sudo restart barricade`

### Configuration Options:

**tag**  
_Tag_ is an arbitrary config value which can be used to identify and organize your Agents - particularly useful for [Filtering Agents](#tagging-filtering). The default value is `production`.

You can e.g. to denote _development, staging, production environments, "commit" versions_, for example: `tag=staging,development,beta`

**spooler_memory**  
This is the specific amount of memory to use for buffering packets in high traffic. By default, the Agent uses available system memory to calculate a reasonable default.

Example: `spooler_memory=10000`

After this, the Agent will begin dropping older packets to prioritize the newest information, and emit a warning to this effect in the logs (/var/log/barricade.log on most systems, in journalctl for systemd based systems).

**flush_frequency**  
Default value is `0.01` seconds.

**log_level**  
The default value is `warning`.

**ssl_check_hostname**  
Allows you to enable or disable SSL hostname verification. By default value is `enabled`.

**filter**
Configures agent to stop capturing certain network traffic.

Example: `filter=port not 22 and port not 53` will prevent the agent from capturing network traffic on SSH and DNS ports.

### Barricade.cfg Troubleshooting

**Some options do not appear in my barricade.cfg file.**  
Your Agent may not be up to date - ensure you have [updated to the latest version](#updating-agents).  

**I'm not sure how to access the file on a server.**  
You'll need connect to the server via SSH to run the command - see [our guide](../getting-started/#running-commands) here.
